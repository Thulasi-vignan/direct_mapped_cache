# direct_mapped_cache
Designed and implemented a direct-mapped cache in Verilog with parameterized data and address width. The module supports read and write operations, maintains a valid bit and tag array, and detects cache hits and misses. The design ensures efficient memory access and cache management using synchronous operations.
